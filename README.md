# Neural_Network_ML
The objective for this assignment was to create a three layered neural network
that would take in input(different hand written images) and "learn" to predict
what number it was. The output is the accuracy percentage. The output is
printed to an Output.txt. If you'd like to make into a matplotlib graph,
uncomment the appropriate lines and indent as necessary.
